In order to create a payout, you need to send a POST request to the `/payouts` endpoint. See an example:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.stg.hellopay.com.co/payouts' \
--data-raw '{
    "amountInCents": 10000,
    "currency": "COP",
    "rail": "BRE_B",
    "reference": "001122",
    "inlineCustomer": {
        "name": "John Doe",
        "idType": "CO_CC",
        "idNumber": "00112233",
        "email": "john.doe@doe.com",
        "phone": ""
    },
    "breb": {
        "keyString": "@alphamunKey01"
    }
}'
```

A special note on some fields of the payload:
- `rail`: corresponds to the payout rail you want to use, `BRE_B` for BREB.
- `inlineCustomer`: corresponds to the information of the customer making the payment. 
- `breb`: This is required if you want to use BREB as the payment rail.
